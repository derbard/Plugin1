This is my first attempt at creating a craftbukkit plugin.

It is not meant to be useful; it is a learning experience for me, and an attempt to have a little fun.

It can be installed like any other craftbukkit plugin.

It has three commands right now: nimbus, change, and midas.

nimbus - As you move, a small platform of gold blocks is generated at your feet, like a little nimbus cloud.
  If you jump or walk into empty space the cloud will continue to generate, letting you travel through the air, but
  currently making it impossible to move downward.  (the command toggles this mode).

change - This command changes every solid block in the current chunk into a specified material.

midas - Same as change, but uses gold blocks as the material.
